# Cardinal Introductory Tutorial

This repository contains the example code used in the [introductory tutorial](https://docs.icure.com/tutorial/basic/sdk-basic-tutorial).
It showcases several self-contained use cases that highlight the main features of the Cardinal SDK, including:

- Creating a patient.
- Generating medical data for that patient (simulating a medical examination with multiple exams).
- Searching through the medical data.
- Sharing the medical data with other doctors and patients.
- Utilizing codifications such as [SNOMED-CT](https://www.snomed.org/what-is-snomed-ct) and [LOINC](https://loinc.org/).

The tutorial code is available in Kotlin, Python, and TypeScript. Below you will find instructions for running the code
in all three languages. For further explanations and examples, check the [Cardinal documentation](https://docs.icure.com).
